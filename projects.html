                        <p class="card-text"><strong>Background:</strong> As a group we analyzed the city-wide bike
                            share
                            programs in New York City and San Francisco, individually then comparing them to each
                            other.
                            Due to limitations we were only able to take a six-month snapshot of the data that was
                            available.
                            The time period we looked at included some winter months and given that New York
                            experiences
                            more of a winter than California that skews the data some, making it appear as though San
                            Francisco
                            has a much higher usage rate than New York City which is not accurate. While total numbers
                            may
                            be off for each location we believe that we are still able to identify trends in the both
                            peak
                            usage times and the type of rider most likely to use the service.

                        <p class="card-text"><strong>Process:</strong> Our data was available online and I downloaded
                            each
                            month for each city individually. Despite them coming from the same source there was a bit
                            of
                            cleaning up of the files that had to be done so that they could all be joined together. The
                            column
                            headers did not match and how gender was indicated differed between cities, as examples. I
                            joined
                            them all into a Pandas DataFrame then broke them out into age group bins and by city to
                            make
                            further analysis easier. I relied heavily on Pandas for analysis of the data and used
                            Matplotlib,
                            Plotly and Seaborn libraries for the data visualizations.</p>

                        <hr>
                        <p class="card-text"><strong>Background:</strong> We pulled a series of datasets from
                            OpenFlights on airline, airports and routes, then creatively figured out how to merge them
                            together into one dataset allowing us to create a map of flight routes, by airline. To
                            reduce the amount of data we were dealing with we decided to limit it to only flights
                            originating from Denver. The biggest
                            challenge in this portion was mainly related to getting an accurate dataset to work with.
                            The individual datasets had similar columns and codes but they were used differently across
                            the data and keeping origin airport and destination airport separate throughout the process
                            took precision.</p>

                        <p>The other main piece of this project included featuring a user-driven search of current
                            flight deals. It is designed for the flexible travel who wants to see what deals are
                            available in a given month. Enter the city code of departure, the month of travel and the
                            country you'd like to travel to and a list of deals is returned in a javascript-driven
                            table. The challenge in this piece of the project was scraping and filtering SkyScanner
                            website. An API made the scraping easier however every possible destination in the database
                            was returned whether flying there was an option or not. To resolve this we had to filter
                            the returned data based on whether there was an image URL included (because only valid
                            destinations included an image on the website) then further by direct and multi-stop
                            pricing criteria.</p>
                        <p>Both pieces are compiled onto a website running with Flask</p>

                        <p class="card-text"><strong>Process:</strong>
                            We used Pandas to clean and merge the datasets and export to
                            geoJSON data so we could graph it. Using Leaflet.js we created a multilayer map graphing
                            the top few airlines' routes/destinations, and also breaking it down to
                            domestic/international, and adding a pop-up giving the name of the airport. </p>

                        <img class="card-img-top" src="images/RunningAcrossAmerica_viz.png" alt="comparison of routes and elevations">
                        <hr>
                        <p class="card-text"> My Running Across America project focused on
                            data from four athletes that ran across the United States in 2016. All of the data was
                            pulled from Strava.com a social network site for fitness enthusiasts. Using Selenium and
                            BeautifulSoup I scrapped the website for each runner pulling GeoJSON data, pace, duration,
                            distance and date of run. The set-up of pages and varied slightly for each runner so I had
                            to have four versions of the scrape code, one file for each runner. I continued to work
                            with each runner individually while I cleaned the data, and filtered down to just the data
                            relevant to their run across America. Working with the JSON data I ended up with over one
                            million rows of data in total. In running calculations on this data, I was finding that my
                            results were not matching the data that was showing on Strava’s website and I knew the
                            results I was returning for average pace just didn’t seem right, even though the
                            math/formula was. The JSON data included points for every time the runner’s watch pinged
                            GPS so approximately every four seconds. I believe Strava’s algorithm is more advanced and
                            able to eliminate data points for when the runner was stopped or other erroneous data, that
                            could be affecting the accuracy of my results. Frustrated with this inaccuracy I decided to
                            scrape Strava again, this time using their front-facing website, rather than accessing the
                            JSON data. One difficulty I ran into with this method was my results included other
                            people’s run data. Since Strava is a social network other people are able to share their
                            runs on other people’s pages. I had to find a way to eliminate this data. I also had Garmin
                            data from one of the runners which provided me a little more in-depth information so I did
                            further analysis on just his run. I kept this data separate from the Strava data, because
                            even though Garmin uploads to Strava the data between the two did not seem to match.</p>

                            <p>Once I had data I was satisfied with I moved into Tableau to create visualizations
                            comparing the four runners and their routes, average pace, distance and time. Using the
                            GeoJSON information I retrieved from Strava I was able to plot their four routes, which in
                            my opinion is one of the most interesting aspects. Along with that I compared altitude,
                            average pace, total duration and total distance run per day. All of these visualizations
                            are controlled by one global filter so you can view just one runner at a time. Some of my
                            further analysis on Jason included comparing elevation and temperature to his average pace
                            as well as table to filter his top five runs, filtered by each variable.</p>

                            <p>The final piece of my project included an attempt at machine learning. I used the Random
                            Forest method to predict the total distance given the variables of duration, runner and
                            average pace. This turned out to be approximately 96% accurate, predicting within 2.4 miles
                            of actual. As expected, total duration of the run has the greatest impact on the total
                            distance of the run. How many days the runner was in to their run, had very little impact
                            on their total distance. All of these runners were very consistent in their pace and
                            distance run each day. In another formula I attempted to predict the runner based on
                            randomly selected data. This set of data was not optimal for machine learning since it was
                            all very consistent and also not a very good representation of typical running.</p>
